      <description>Setting Up You will need to load the tidyverse package and also reload the data from Part 1 if you changed your R environment (new project).
# load the tidyverse package library(tidyverse) We finished Part 1 looking at the linear relationships between two explanatory variables (bank orders and traffic controller orders), and our target variable (total orders). In the charts we created a formula for the linear regression line that resulted from our analyses in the format \(\hat{y} =161,000 + 1.</description>

      <description>I recommend this book to help you understand where ordinary least squares (OLS) regression fits within the most common statistical learning approaches:
James et al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) 1st ed. 2013, Corr. 7th printing 2017 Edition
With so many options available to students and practitioners it is rare to find a book that takes both an accessible-theoretical and practical approach to econometrics and machine learning.</description>

      <description>Installing and Loading the Reticulate Package This package allows us to run Python 3 inside R Markdown chunks. You will need Python 3 installed. There are details on how to do that in the Resources section of the blog. I also needed to change Reticulate’s settings to point it at Python3 on my Mac. You can find those details here.
Of course, you do not need to run Python from Rstudio, or within the R framework.</description>

      <description>Are Manchester United fans more critical of their team than opposing fans about theirs? This was the (too ambitious) question I intended to answer when I began this piece but having discovered some of the difficulties in accessing bulk, multi-period Twitter data I have scaled it back. I certainly intend to revisit the bigger question using Twitter scraping solutions that have since become available, but for now I’ll restrict myself to the more achievable question:</description>

      <title>R-Tips #1: Turning Off and On Scientific Notation</title>

      <description>options(scipen = 999) #the command that turns off scientific notation in R output I often set this parameter in any R project in which I’ll be evaluating predictive model performance. But why would you want to turn off scientific notation? First, it’s a personal preference, but I strongly advocate for learning how to read scientific notation as it is a data science standard. Second, your audience may not be mathematically trained.</description>
