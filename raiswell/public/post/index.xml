      <description>Installing and Loading the Reticulate Package This package allows us to run Python 3 inside R Markdown chunks. You will need Python 3 installed. There are details on how to do that in the Resources section. I also needed to change Reticulate’s settings to point it at Python 3 on my Mac. You can find those details here.
