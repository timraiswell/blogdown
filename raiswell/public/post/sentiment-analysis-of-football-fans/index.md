<p>I’ll start this analysis with the question I want to answer:</p>
<p><strong>Are Manchester United fans more critical of their team than opposing fans about theirs?</strong></p>
<p>I love English football. I was born and grew up in Manchester, England, but now I live in the States and I’m forced to follow the English Premiership remotely. I like to track my Twitter feed during games to see the opinion of other fans. One thing I noticed was the propensity of Manchester United fans to expect heroics from the team on a weekly basis and I wondered whether it was any different for fans of other clubs.</p>
<p>Before I attempt to answer the question, I review existing work in this space to ensure I’m saving time where I can and building from others’ terrain knowledge.</p>
