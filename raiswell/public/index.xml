      <description>Hi there. My intent with this site is to share useful analytic ideas and tools - from basic to advanced - that have made my work easier and more fun.
Current Employment I am a research principal in Gartner&amp;rsquo;s finance practice. I currently use quantitative and qualitative research methods to answer hard questions for chief financial officers and their finance teams. I have been in a related role at CEB (now Gartner) for thirteen years, with visits to the worlds of product development and management, sales support and client advisory services.</description>

      <description>I will mostly use R and Python in these notes and case studies. Both languages have fantastic resources to help you access the relevant software and packages for data analysis use-cases whether you&amp;rsquo;re using MacOS, Windows or a Linux instance.
Installing R Install the R language
Install the R-Studio IDE
Installing Python Install Anaconda
Anaconda installs the latest version of the Python language (if you&amp;rsquo;re new to this, use version 3.</description>

      <description>Installing and Loading the Reticulate Package This package allows us to run Python 3 inside R Markdown chunks. You will need Python 3 installed. There are details on how to do that in the Resources section of the blog. I also needed to change Reticulate’s settings to point it at Python3 on my Mac. You can find those details here.
Of course, you do not need to run Python from Rstudio, or within the R framework.</description>

      <description>Are Manchester United fans more critical of their team than opposing fans about theirs? This was the (too ambitious) question I intended to answer when I began this piece but having discovered some of the difficulties in accessing bulk, multi-period Twitter data I have scaled it back. I certainly intend to revisit the bigger question using Twitter scraping solutions that have since become available, but for now I’ll restrict myself to the more achievable question:</description>

      <description>options(scipen = 999) #the command that turns off scientific notation in R output I often set this parameter in any R project in which I’ll be evaluating predictive model performance. But why would you want to turn off scientific notation? First, it’s a personal preference, but I strongly advocate for learning how to read scientific notation as it is a data science standard. Second, your audience may not be mathematically trained.</description>
