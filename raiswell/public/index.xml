      <description>Hi there. My intent with this site is to share useful analytic ideas and tools - from basic to advanced - that have made my work easier and more fun.
Current Employment I am a research principal in Gartner&amp;rsquo;s finance practice. I currently use quantitative and qualitative research methods to answer hard questions for chief financial officers and their finance teams. I have been in a related role at CEB (now Gartner) for thirteen years, with visits to the worlds of product development and management, sales support and client advisory services.</description>

      <title>Removing scientific notation in R</title>

      <description>options(scipen = 999) # this command turns off scientific notation in R output
I often set this parameter in any R project in which I’ll be evaluating predictive model performance. But why would you want to turn off scientific notation?
Scientific notation is shorthand for large number strings. For example:
 The number 0.00000000002 is written in R output in the scientific notation format as 2e-11
 Basically, this approach takes the integer “2”, puts a decimal point in front of it (1 of the 11), and counts off the remainder of the e-numbers (10) as decimal places.</description>
