      <description>I recommend this book to help you understand where ordinary least squares (OLS) regression fits within the most common statistical learning approaches:
James et al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R (Springer Texts in Statistics) 1st ed. 2013, Corr. 7th printing 2017 Edition
With so many options available to students and practitioners it is rare to find a book that takes both an accessible-theoretical and practical approach to econometrics and machine learning.</description>

      <description>Installing and Loading the Reticulate Package This package allows us to run Python 3 inside R Markdown chunks. You will need Python 3 installed. There are details on how to do that in the Resources section of the blog. I also needed to change Reticulateâ€™s settings to point it at Python3 on my Mac. You can find those details here.
Of course, you do not need to run Python from Rstudio, or within the R framework.</description>
