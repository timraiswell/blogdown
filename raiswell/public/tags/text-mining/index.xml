Are Manchester United fans more critical of their team than opposing fans about theirs?
I love English football. I was born and grew up in Manchester, England, but now I live in the States and I’m forced to follow the English Premiership remotely.

One thing I noticed was the propensity of Manchester United fans to expect heroics from the team on a weekly basis and I wondered whether it was any different for fans of other clubs.</description>
