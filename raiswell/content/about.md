My intent with this site is **to share useful analytic ideas and tools  - from basic to advanced - that have made my work easier and fun.**

<h1>Current Employment</h1>

I am a research VP in Gartner's finance practice. I currently use quantitative and qualitative research methods to answer hard questions for chief financial officers and their finance teams. I have been in a related role at CEB (now Gartner) for thirteen years, with visits to the worlds of product development and management, sales support and client advisory services.

I have a particular interest in the following management fields at large enterprises: 

<ul>
<li>Growth investment management, specficially why so many companies are bad at it; </li>
<li>Financial, and shared services organizational design; </li>
<li>Financial forecasting;</li>
<li>Financial analytics, including data management; </li>
<li>Financial talent acquisition and development. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Analytics & Data Science</h2>
While I have worked with quantitative teams throughout my career, in 2017 I embarked on a course of formal data science and business analytics training through a masters program at NYU's Stern Business School. I have since developed a passion for data mining and machine learning. This set of notes is my attempt to give back to the global analytics community. 

In the field of data science and analytics I have particular interests in the following areas:

<ul>
<li>Business applications of machine learning; </li>
<li>Text mining and analytics in business and non-business contexts (e.g. social media, news media, literature); </li>
<li>Data visualization and story-telling; </li>
<li>R and python for data science exploration and deployment;</li>
<li>Football (the British type) analytics.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Literature</h2>
I began my academic training in the Humanities. When I'm not working, writing these notes or spending time with my family, I enjoy reading. My top ten reads (in no particular order) are:

1. *The Master and Margarita*, Mikhael Bulgakov
2. *The Real Life of Sebastian Knight,* Vladimir Nabokov
3. *The Brothers Karamazov*, Fyodor Dostoevsky
4. *Zeno's Conscience*, Italo Svevo
5. *Birthday Letters*, Ted Hughes
6. *The Alexandria Quartet*, Lawrence Durrell
7. *The Good Soldier,* Ford Madox Ford
8. *Our Man in Havana*, Graham Greene
9. *A Farewell to Arms*, Ernest Hemingway
10. *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man*, James Joyce
