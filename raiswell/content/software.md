I will mostly use R and Python in these notes and case studies. Both languages have fantastic resources to help you access the relevant software and packages for data analysis use-cases whether you're using MacOS, Windows or a Linux instance. 

<h2>Installing R</h2>

[**Install the R language**](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)  
[**Install the R-Studio IDE**](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

<h2>Installing Python</h2>

[**Install Anaconda**](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)  
Anaconda installs the latest version of the Python language (if you're new to this, use version 3.X, not the obsolescent 2.7), several data science and analytic packages, and a few options for coding interfaces, including the popular (and recommended) Jupyter Notebooks. [Jupyter](www.jupyter.org) is a browser-based interface for Python.
